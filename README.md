# neural-flow-generative

## Summary

[Updated] A signle page web application. Create 'Neural Flow' - a sophisticated generative art system that creates evolving, organic flow fields like watching thoughts form in a neural network.

üß† CONCEPT:
Autonomous agents (particles) flow through an invisible force field, leaving elegant trails that form mesmerizing patterns. The field constantly evolves using Perlin noise, creating organic, never-repeating formations. It's hypnotic, sophisticated, and beautiful - like watching consciousness emerge.

üé® VISUAL SYSTEM:
- Dark background (deep navy to black gradient)
- Thousands of tiny particles (2-3px) flowing through space
- Particles leave fading trails creating smooth, flowing lines
- Color palette shifts slowly through sophisticated gradients:
  * Monochrome (white/gray on black) - minimalist
  * Warm (gold/amber/copper) - organic
  * Cool (cyan/blue/purple) - digital
  * Dual-tone (complementary colors) - dynamic
- Particles glow subtly, trails have slight opacity gradient
- Overall aesthetic: VERY high-end, gallery-worthy, not 'toyish'

‚öôÔ∏è THE ALGORITHM:
- Perlin/Simplex noise field determines flow direction at each point
- Noise field evolves over time (4th dimension)
- Particles follow field vectors, creating organic curves
- Speed varies based on field intensity
- Particles respawn at edges, maintaining density
- Optional: particles avoid/attract each other (flocking behavior)

üéÆ INTERACTIONS:
- Click/drag: Disturb the field (creates turbulence)
- Mouse position: Subtle influence on flow direction
- Scroll: Zoom into the pattern
- Spacebar: Pause/resume evolution
- 'S' key: Save current frame as image
- 'C' key: Cycle color palettes
- 'R' key: Randomize parameters, generate new pattern
- Number keys 1-5: Switch between preset configurations:
  1. Smooth Flow - gentle, meditative curves
  2. Turbulent - chaotic, energy
  3. Vortex - spiraling, hypnotic
  4. Waves - undulating patterns
  5. Neural - branching, network-like

üéõÔ∏è UI (Minimal, Elegant):
- Top left: Current mode name (fades after 2s)
- Bottom right: Subtle controls overlay (appears on hover):
  * Particle count slider (1k - 50k)
  * Flow speed multiplier
  * Trail length
  * Color palette selector
- Bottom left: 'Save Frame' icon button
- All UI in elegant, thin sans-serif font
- Controls have subtle glass-morphism effect

üí´ ADVANCED FEATURES:
- Time-based evolution: pattern never repeats
- Multiple noise layers for complexity
- Particle lifetime affects trail opacity
- Optional: audio reactivity (if user plays music)
- Performance scaling: reduces particles if FPS drops
- Export settings to URL (shareable configurations)

üéØ PRESETS (Each feels completely different):

1. **Consciousness Stream**: Slow, wide trails, warm colors, meditative
2. **Digital Rain**: Fast downward flow, matrix-green, cyberpunk
3. **Silk**: Ultra-smooth, monochrome, minimal, gallery-worthy
4. **Aurora**: Undulating like northern lights, cool gradients
5. **Mycelium**: Branching organic networks, earthy tones

‚ú® TECHNICAL:
- Canvas-based with efficient particle system
- Use typed arrays for performance (Float32Array)
- Offscreen canvas for trails (composition)
- WebGL shaders if possible for 50k+ particles
- Perlin noise implementation (or simplex-noise library)
- RequestAnimationFrame with delta time
- Responsive canvas (fills viewport)

üé® THE AESTHETIC:
- Think: Electric Objects art display, not game
- Screensaver-quality, museum-piece, 'I want this on my wall'
- Sophisticated color theory, not garish
- Smooth, organic motion, not jittery
- You could watch this for hours
- Professional designers would be impressed

üî• WHY IT'S IMPRESSIVE:
- Algorithmically complex but visually simple
- Every instance is unique, never repeats
- Sophisticated taste - not kitsch
- Technical achievement (smooth at 60fps with thousands of particles)
- Shareable ('Check out this pattern I generated')
- Could be an actual art installation
- Appeals to tech people AND artists

This is the kind of thing you pull up at a dinner party and people gather around to watch. Or you fullscreen on a big monitor and it becomes your living room ambient art. Quality over spectacle.
